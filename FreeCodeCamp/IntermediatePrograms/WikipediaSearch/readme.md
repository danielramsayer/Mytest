### Javascript - Wikipedia Search
***

#### Objective
This application was designed to make available the search hits on Wikipedia for a user based on their input.

#### Steps Taken

I began by focusing on the visual representation after deciding which kinds of input and background I found appealing to the user.

This was heavily reliant on utilizing the Wikipedia API integration. The search parameters were passed to the API and the first 10 likely candidates.

Here is the code for the [Wikipedia Search](https://github.com/danielramsayer/School_work/tree/master/FreeCodeCamp/IntermediatePrograms/WikipediaSearch).

Here is a CodePen functional version of [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/Daniel_Ramsayer/pen/EmmJxJ)

#### The Result

The wikipedia search provides the intended results, while providing a visually engaging background that is along the lines of what one would expect for wikipedia API integration.
