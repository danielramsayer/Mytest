    <p class="lead">Somehow, you've found your way to this page. Be aware, dear visitor, that this website will thrill, chill, and may make you shrill.</p>
    <hr>
    <p> You are Cody Dwellington, and this is your first hackathon. Welcome! Things are starting out well enough. You’ve met a some nice people, and the snacks are good. There is a loud thunderstorm outside, and the lights are a little dimmer than you would expect. But, it is a “themed” hackathon.</p>

<p>Perhaps they are just trying to set the Halloween mood?</p>

<p>You are finishing up an interesting conversation with someone else who, like you, is attending a code school and doing an internship... when the organizer starts making the opening announcements. </p>

<p>But, halfway through, the lights go out.</p>

<p>You’re in the dark now, and after everyone lets out a little gasp, you hear the sound of wet chewing... Then the projector turns on in the dark room. </p>

<p>It displays a movie quote:</p>

<p id="quote">"A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti."</p>

<p>After reading the quote, you hear from the other room someone yell in a goofy yet menacing voice, “I hope you like scary movies!”</p>

<p>Then the lights come back on.</p>

<p>You are relieved until you realize that you’re itching. You look down… You have ants on your hands! There are ants on the keyboard - your pockets are full of ants!</p>

<p>You go outside and shake yourself free of this little army of terror. Then, after some vigorous hand washing, you return to your team. You tell them, that was odd, and they agree. </p>

<p>You open Github to start working when the lights go out again. And, on-comes-the-projector. It reads:</p>

<p id="quote">"I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass…and I’m all out of bubblegum."</p>

<p>The people laugh this time, and they think it must be a ruse. So, you all get back to work for a good spell after that. But then...</p>

<p>You notice the API documentation you’re reading includes nonsensical steps about burying bodies and redirecting you to Wikihow articles on how to hide murder weapons. That’s when you realize the API isn’t a RESTful API working with “JSON”, it’s a “RESTless” spooky API working with “Jason,” the main character from Friday the 13th. </p>

<p>Oh my... You wonder at this point if you might simply be losing your mind...When, of course, the lights go out again, and another quote pops up on the projector:</p>

<p id="quote">“Here’s Johnny!”</p>

<p>This time, after reading the quote and as the lights come back on, you realize that your fellow-hackathon go-ers have pulled away from their computer screens and stood up from their chairs. </p>

<p>They are all looking at the large window in the room. You now stand up, and you look too. </p>

<p>There are what must be a count of 15, 9 ft, pale-greyish extraterrestrials standing at the window, pressing their hands to the glass... Looking at them, you suddenly feel type of magnetic pulse coursing through your heart, like some sort of emotional-telepathic connection.</p>

<p>Then, as you become quite terrified, the organizer goes in front of the projector to make the final announcement:</p>

<p>“Surprise! You don’t even have to finish your projects; you are all winners! Go to the window and press your hand to the glass to claim your prize…</p>

<p>Think that’s it? Is that the end?</p>
